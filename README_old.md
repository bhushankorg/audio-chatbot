# AI Chatbot Project Overview

## Objective

Build a complete AI-powered chatbot that communicates with users via a simple web interface. The chatbot will be powered by OpenAIâ€™s GPT API and hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. The system will be easy to use, responsive, and capable of storing conversations for later analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python FastAPI
- **Frontend:** HTML/React JS
- **AI Engine:** LLM API (option to switch to LLaMA2)
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2 with Nginx, Docker for containerized deployment
- **Storage:** SQLite (or PostgreSQL for advanced setup)
- **Security:** AWS secrets key management and optional user login

- Simple database (SQLite) or optional PostgreSQL support.

### Web Interface
- Clean and responsive design.
- Works on mobile and desktop.
- Option to reset conversation.

### Security & Deployment
- Secure API key management (.env file).
- Deployed using Gunicorn and Nginx on Ubuntu EC2.
- SSL enabled using Let's Encrypt.
- Optional Docker support for simplified setup and deployment.

### Optional Enhancements
- User login system (email/password).
- Analytics dashboard for chat insights.
- Replace OpenAI API with local model (e.g., LLaMA2).
